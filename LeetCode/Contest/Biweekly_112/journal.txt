# Objective.

1. Push codes and all.
2. Again an abrupt start came from the driving lesson and directly jumped to code.

# Experience

1. The start was very bad.
2. It took over 5 attempts just to solve the first goddamn question.
3. I am proud of the second question, even though it was not a hard question.
    1. The earlier me would have just given up on the question, but the new me fought well and conquered the question.
4. About the third question yeah that was kind of disappointment.
    1. I tried to complicate stuff even more than it was, by trying to inculcate Kadanes algorithm. To find the sum, silly me.
    2. But I can proudly say that I finally solved the question beyond the time limit.

# Learning

1. I get nervous and fumble and make mistakes and gambles.
    1. If I just be more focused and more efficient while dry running the solutions and all I could easily do it in time.
2. It is possible to solve the third question of the leetcode contest and jump up the rating chart.
    1. It's not gonna happen overnight I have to strategically plan and execute this thing.
    2. I have to pick topics, like DP, Graph, Recursion, Sliding window prefix sum, and all. And do medium or difficult questions on them.
    3. Time is one of the biggest things.
        1. It doesn't mean that I don’t have to think or do a dry run.
        2. If I just be more focused and more efficient while dry running the solutions and all I could easily do it in time.
3. I need to work on another thing.
    1. When I am focused and doing the right thing, I tend to do it slower which leads to more time taken.
    2. As of now, I don't think that I need to focus on that aspect if I just work to calm my nerves avoid silly mistakes, and not waste time and be more focused. My path will be clearer than ever before.
4. Don’t try to complicate things more than it is.
    1. Like in the third question, there was no need to apply kadanes algorithm in it.
5. Result wise this was not a great contest, but if you ask me personally it was a banger of a contest, so many things to learn in such a short amount of time.
6. Last time I solved 2 and attempted the other two
    1. I said that I could solve one of them, But I know the difference between saying and and doing right?
    2. This time I did solve one of them, but beyond the time limit.
    3. For future I have to try to do it in competition.
    4. For further future i have to do it in again and agian.

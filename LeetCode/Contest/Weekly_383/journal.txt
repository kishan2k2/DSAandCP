# Objective

1. To give my best shot.
2. To calm my nerves.
3. To do less of the errors.
4. Not being kanjoos and not eager.
    1. I have to understand that it is not CodeChef. It is leetcode 2 questions are what I usually do.
    2. The regret of penalty>>not doing fast.
        1. Got 7 penalties though.
5. Upsolve question 4 before going ahead.

# Experience

1. The experience was the best not gonna lie.
2. I was not kanjoos.
3. I just can’t believe it, I was so close to the end time[2:39 left].
    1. But I just maintained my nerves and just smashed it. 
    2. So proud of myself.
4. Even though I was able to solve 3 q’s in the last virtual_contest as well.
    1. But there is difference in solving it in virtual and in contest.
    2. And a personal and based opinion but this contest was tuff than the previous one, especially the third question.

# Learnings

1. Two things that worked this time.
    1. Believing and focused work.
        1. This doesn’t imply that if you believe even the wrong algorithm with work.
        2. This means that if you believe you can make the correct algorithm required.
2. Giving the contest in the right mood will serve me well.
    1. Dont wait for the right mood, create the right mood.
    2. Even if you are not in the right mood give the contest anyway.
3. Dependency on GPT has been reduced.
4. From now on new goals.
    1. Try to solve 3 q’s in the contest.
    2. Reduce the use of GPT.
    3. Reduce penalty.

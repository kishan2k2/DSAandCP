## Objective.

1. Push the codes.
2. I want to see the effect of giving so much efforts and brainstorming of yesterday.
3. All the objectives of the yesterdays contest.
4. To give my best and not to give till the last moment.
5. Whenever you feel like giving up, give it a break.
    1. Take a deep breath.
    2. Start reading the question again, think of all the approaches. No matter you can code it yourself or not just think.
    3. Collect all the observations and connect them to make something magical.
6. Don’t be kanjoos while doing dry run and all.
7. Use the double penetration method.
8. Print to debug that is the best way to go.
9. Don’t get overwhelmed.
    1. Remember the only thing that will stop you from solving the question is you.
10. Be prepared for the fuckups.
    1. New ide, new platform something will break for sure, but it will break for all and that will give me a good opportunity.
11. Treat a question like a question, the only purpose is to solve that and not to think about previous or the next.
12. It’s only you other don’t matter don’t do it for rank.
13. Way to solve the question.
    1. Start reading the question.
    2. While reading you will have bias and will automatically solving the question right away.
        1. In easier question the answer might even be true. 
        2. But it is not worth it.
    3. If you are having a strong urge then try to write it down.
    4. Try to understand the complete aspect of the question.
        1. Even though it will take time but it will be worth it.
        2. There are questions where they want to test that thing only.
    5. Case 1-: In some questions you will get the algorithm right away.
    6. Case 2-: In some other questions you will have to dry run to find the pattern.
    7. Case 3-: In some other questions you would have the idea of how to solve it, using some technique or a data structure or some other optimisation.
    8. What ever is the case it is important to stop typing on the computer and take a paper and pen and breakdown the approach.
    9. If it is something new i.e. the case 3 then learn about the data structure or the technique.
    10. If it is the Case 2 then do the dry run and keep a list of observations and then combine it and make the magic happen.
    11. If it is case 1, or other cases converge to this one then validate the algorithm with time and space complexity analysis. See where and how  you can optimise if needed.
    12. Write the algorithm on pen and paper, using the double penetration method.
    13. And while coding code it part wise and always test the code while writing itself.
    14. If everything is done in the right sequence and way then boom you did it my guy, HAPPY AC ;)

## Experience.

1. So  much difficult.
2. Such a bad contest.
3. Atleast I didn’t give till the very last even though I felt it.
    1. And Iam proud of it.
    2. I have improved on it.

## Learning

1. I will give it a break.
2. I will give the next contest only when I complete some topics.

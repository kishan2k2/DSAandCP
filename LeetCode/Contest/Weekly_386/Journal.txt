    1. Too difficult
4. To upsolve codeforces
    1. Didn’t feel like it.

# Experience

1. Iam getting a bit sick of contest and all.
    1. It is causing some issues.
        1. Cause Iam not progressing as before.
2. I could have done it easily if I approached the question like I did it from start.
    1. But would it be worth it.
    2. I mean if I could find no other optimised solution then there was no chance of not doing it.
3. One thing will change which might help.
    1. Once I shift to flat, I wont have to think of food and all during contest and all.

# Learning

1. I should have believed myself, rather than going here and there. Should have done with full full focus and honesty.
    1. I don’t get those who say you should see other questions as well. I mean questions are sorted in order of difficulty, then why to preoccupy your brain with a even more difficult question.
    2. In leetcode contest specifically.
        1. If I feel like one question is bruteforce, and it might take long to code.
            1. You most prolly are in the right path.
            2. Just breakdown the problem and solve the god damn question.

    ## Objective

1. Last few contest i.e. hack with infy and leetcode contest were so bad that It demotivated me alot.
2. I came back, even after such bad performance.
3. I just need to do my best.
4. I know that if I don’t quit or crib I wont regret it at any cost.
5. Respect the question, the contest and you will get it as well.
6. To post in github as well.
7. Correct approach.
    1. Start reading the question.
    2. While reading you will have bias and will automatically solving the question right away.
        1. In easier question the answer might even be true. 
        2. But it is not worth it.
    3. If you are having a strong urge then try to write it down.
        1.  On pen and a paper or with comments.
    4. Try to understand the complete aspect of the question.
        1. Even though it will take time but it will be worth it.
        2. There are questions where they want to test that thing only.
    5. Case 1-: In some questions you will get the algorithm right away.
    6. Case 2-: In some other questions you will have to dry run to find the pattern.
    7. Case 3-: In some other questions you would have the idea of how to solve it, using some technique or a data structure or some other optimisation.
    8. What ever is the case it is important to stop typing on the computer and take a paper and pen and breakdown the approach.
    9. If it is something new i.e. the case 3 then learn about the data structure or the technique.
    10. If it is the Case 2 then do the dry run and keep a list of observations and then combine it and make the magic happen.
    11. If it is case 1, or other cases converge to this one then validate the algorithm with time and space complexity analysis. See where and how  you can optimise if needed.
    12. Write the algorithm on pen and paper, using the double penetration method.
    13. And while coding code it part wise and always test the code while writing itself.
    14. If everything is done in the right sequence and way then boom you did it my guy, HAPPY AC ;)
8. Don’t be kanjoos and not at all impatient.
    1. Be calm and handle it well.
9. I will see the time vs graph of the first and the second question.
    1. I think that I was quite fast in the first quesiton, but I could have been a bit faster in the second question.

## Experience.

1. I was so happy on how quick and efficient was the first question.
2. Even though I was stuck at question 3, I tried my best and did what I could, no regrets.

## Learning

1. If I just try my best without any fear and expectation, I wont be having any regrets.

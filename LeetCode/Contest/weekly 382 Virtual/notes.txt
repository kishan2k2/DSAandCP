# Objective.

1. To solve the questions.
2. To make a plan on how to do dsa now.
    1. It's not just about the topics to complete but also about the problem-solving.
    2. I have done DataStrcuture and DAA. And I don’t have much of the theory left, I have to do question practice more often.
    3. Don’t Ignore CP, the industry level is increasing and I have adapted to it.
        1. Some topics I want to be good at i.e. they always sting me.
        2. Matrices, DP, bit manipulation, greedy.
    4. Doing just a sheet is not a bad idea anyway.
3. To test a hypothesis.
    1. Whether doing Development improves my dsa problem-solving abilities. 
        1. Yes, indeed it does.
4. Just remember the previous learnings.
    1. Doing one thing at a time, and not being kanjoos while testing the algorithm helped.
5. Push the code to Git Hub.
    1. Done.

# Experience.

1. The second one was so much more difficult, ahh shit. But I did it somehow.
2. The third one was easy.
3. Didn’t even try the fourth question, knowing that it is a bit manipulation question.
4. Surprisingly no DP-based question this time. 
5. No question from DP or any standard data structure, I guess I heard it right that leetcode is becoming more like any other competitive programming platform.
6. I am just happy that I could do three questions.

# Learning.

1. What does transform do?
    1. It is more like a lambda or a loop that does the operation on the elements. 
2. error due to long long didn’t expect that in the leetcode problems.
3. error due to precedence error.
4. The biggest difference between the previous me and the new me is how much I can sit now.
5. Xor-based questions to do.
6. Even though I did the third one in a virtual contest that too took way more time. I dont think I could have pulled that off in a real contest.
7. No question from DP or any standard data structure, I guess I heard it right that leetcode is becoming more like any other competitive programming platform.

# Plan for dsa.

1. For now, I believe that doing a sheet should be enough.
2. But I have some topics to do/to be good at.
    1. DP.
    2. Graph.
    3. Matrix related questions.
    4. Bit manipulation-related questions.
    5. Maybe I can study them separately meanwhile doing sheets.

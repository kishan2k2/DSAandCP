# Learnings

1. Don’t be kanjoos while solving dry runs of the test cases and all.
2. Just one question at a time, give it your all.
3. Believe in yourself even before trying, try it, and attempt it with full honesty.
    1. Don't get overwhelmed.
    2. Believing in yourself doesn’t mean premature celebration.
4. I believe that checking out the most popular solutions, especially in leetcode is not the way to go, cause they tend to over-optimise the solution which makes it hard to interpret.
    1. I know that it is the final destination of any programmer, but we can’t learn from it especially the topics over which we don't have good command over.
5. In the leetCode contest, keep track of test cases.
6. Dont just overcomplicate things.
    1. Start with brute force if you don’t know the solution right away.
    2. See the constraints, and decide where in the way you can optimize and find a way to optimize.
7. Rating will increase but please don’t get attached to it.
    1. Adapt and improvise while being disattached.
    2. Neither see the submission rate and get disheartened or get excited.
8. Be relaxed calm before the contest, atleast try to be.
9. Use of GPT for minor error handling or some syntactical issues.
10. Contest doesn’t has alot of the standard dsa based questions.
    1. So in short contest is not an alternative to dsa.
    2. Solving sheet helps.
11. Fuck ups, i.e. be well prepared and avoid those next time.
    1. Be sure of the timing and be calm. Especially in codeforces contest.
    2. Ready the file path already. In codeforces.
    3. Always ll datatype no matter what.
        1. Not doing this just causes nuisance. 
    4. Keep everything in silent mode, dnd mode. Laptop phone and all.
        1. I live in pg so keep the headphone active if needed.
12. Confidence comes from not giving up.
13. Variables and functions are the lifeline of a program if you mess them up they will mess you up.
    1. Using the rubber duck trick, i.e. talk out loud.
14. Have realistic expectation.
    1. If it is codeforces div 2, then it is different then div 3 right?
15. See if the objectives are satisfied after everycontest.
16. Sometimes it's just about breaking down the problem and solving it part by part.
    1. CP all about that, it is the spirit.

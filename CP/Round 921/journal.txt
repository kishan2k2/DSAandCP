# Objective

1. One question at a time.
2. Don't be kanjoos while testing the algorithm test all the edge cases.
3. While doing a question be accountable.
    1. Which algo you are making? Testing? Rejected algo?
    2. Time spent on what?
4. Make sure to progress ahead and not get stuck in some silly thing.
5. Upsolve the remaining question.
6. I think I always get stuck in the DP question.
    1. See the question rating and the question type.
    2. If not ad-hoc I can practice it more often.

# Experience

1. Feeling a lot of sleepy. Nearly slept off while meditating.
2. Not prepared well for the contest.
    1. Small things that just disturb the experience.
3. Problem C -: Is it string matching or DP idk?
4. I thought that I was so close to solving the third question.
    1. Like always nothing to be proud of.
    2. Especially cause I used chatGPT.
    3. Rank improved from 18K to 8K. But a lot of improvement is required.
    4. Though I need to upsolve it and see its rating as well?
    5. I think that it was a hard question, but dont just satisfy your ego based on that. I know my reality and how much I need to work on myself.

# Learning

1. There are a lot of things to be learned from this contest.
2. Be well-rested before the contest.
3. Dont fuck up, especially with the templates and all.
4. Use GPT precisely.
    1. But try to avoid it, I am somehow scared that I will be dependent on it and unable to solve it on my own.
    2. Though that is way better than doing nothing.
    3. **The best use of GPT that I found was that spend more time in explaining the question to GPT.**
    4. **Cause that is the issue, if I understand the question completely I will be able to solve the question{Or identify the algorithm or the pattern}.**
5. Things I should continue.
    1. The concept of one question at a time was of great help.
    2. Also accounting for the time spent on the question was very helpful.
        1. Time spent on testing the algorithm.
        2. Making the algorithm.
        3. Improving the algorithm.
        4. Rejecting the algorithm.

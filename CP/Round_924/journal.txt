# Objective

1. Nor be afraid of writing big code neither be lazy enough to write big.
    1. If time and space satisfies it will pass.
        1. Yeah i followed it cause algorithm hi nahi bahi. ðŸ¤£
2. If stuck use the rubber duck trick.
3. Use GPT wisely.
    1. It will only help in a bit of syntax only, and a bit of silly error handling[Not the logical ones though].
    2. Didnâ€™t used it at all, good decision.
4. Donâ€™t forget to upsolve the question.
    1. Lets see if I can find the solution.
5. Donâ€™t try to quit or loosen up in the last quesitons.
    1. Cause it is where the real growth is.
    2. And these questions are only asked in interviews and all and that too and in the start.
        1. Do it with full honesty.

# Experience

1. It is div 2 baby.
    1. Did only two questions.
    2. Canâ€™t expect much from div 2. 
    3. Keeping the expectations clear is also a blessing in disguise.
2. There we so many fuckups in this contest I will list them in learnings.
3. Major disappointment was because I could have done the third question but didnâ€™t do it so.
    1. I thought that I could do the third question, but so did the other people who tried.
    2. I just couldnâ€™t make the algorithm, and I hate it.
4. I didnâ€™t give up and iam proud of that.
    1. Even though the results didnâ€™t show them but it will soon in some or the other form.
    2. Give up not only because the contest was hard to solve.
    3. But also because there were so many fuckups.

# Learning

1. Confidence comes from not giving up.
2. Fuck ups, i.e. be well prepared and avoid those next time.
    1. Be sure of the timing and be calm. Especially in codeforces contest.
    2. Ready the file path already. In codeforces.
    3. Always ll datatype no matter what.
        1. Not doing this just causes nuisance. 
    4. Keep everything in silent mode, dnd mode. Laptop phone and all.
        1. I live in pg so keep the headphone active if needed.

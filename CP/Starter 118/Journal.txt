# Objective

1. It's the first contest in Div 3 all the best.
2. Give it your all.
3. Use GPT or whatever you need.
4. Dont see the graph cause it will distract you.
5. Doing it in brute force way if it is stuck, then ask chatGPT for optimization.

# Experience

1. The start was rough, the first question took time to solve.
2. Questions 2 and 3 were easy to solve.
3. Was stuck in question no 4.
    1. Was quite distracted as well, focus was not at its peak.
    2. But still, I solved it partially.
    3. But I wasn't at all near the most optimal solution.
    4. next question was the next part of this question so couldn't do it as well.
4. The 5th question seems doable using DP or some pattern matching.
    1. But there wasn't much time left.
5. Final summary-: 
    1.  I was already very much tired but I still gave the competition, It didn’t go much well.

# Learning.

1. Don’t rely too much on GPT, it can only act as an assistant not the brain of the code.
    1. In this situation, GPT couldn’t do anything because I didn’t even know the approach, i.e. the pattern.
2. Don’t have a lot of expectations, have minimal expectations, and work the most.
    1. But the thing is that the most critical analysis comes when I am the most hurt, and I am mostly hurt when the expectation doesn’t match the reality.
    2. Need to ponder upon that a bit more.
3. ChatGPT cannot just optimise the algorithm especially if it is an ad-hoc question.
4. Need to solve the question 5.

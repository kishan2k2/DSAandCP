# Objective

1. In the past few contests, I have been performing well but have been disappointed cause of not being able to solve the doable questions in the time given.
    1. I have to conquer that now.
    2. The strategy is not to do it fast.
    3. The strategy is to calm your nerves and focus on what needs to be done.
    4. Other strategies are don’t be kanjoos while testing the test cases and dry runs.
    5. Be the biggest critique of your code.
        1. Good thing to keep in mind.

# Experience.

1. Fuck the template thing, just build your own according to requirement at least there will be a flow.
2. I was stuck in such a silly mistake, OMG. I don’t know how to hack even worked out.
3. The timing in the preloaded question fucked me up, fr.

# Learnings

1. After sufficient rest, I must do the solving of question 5.
2. Improvement toh hai i.e. within 1000 rank aa gaya.
3. Lekin could have done it faster.
    1. Fuckups ho gaye thode bahut, yeah template ki MKC.
4. The thing is preload the question be be aware of the fact that time is statically loaded and doesn’t change dynamically until I reload the page.
    1. Preload the question but do refresh the page.
5. I need to control my emotions.
    1. Don’t get carried away with others’ performance.
    2. Even though peaked my rating chart, I was still dissatisfied cause someone else performed better.
        1. Yeah, they performed better cause they must be prepared for it.
        2. Don’t forget I made such a great project with langchain, gemini, and streamlit even deployed it to show the world.
        3. Was drained out and tired but still gave the contest and killed it by peaking my ratings and all.
6. Couldn’t satisfy the objective at all.
7. I don’t know why even after thinking about it I just rushed into coding.
    1. That got me in question 4.
8. Good thing to keep in mind.
    1. Be the biggest critique of your own code.
9. The first thing is acceptance.
    1. I have to stop acting like If I had time I could have done the last question.
    2. Common it was 2k+ rated, I have a long way to go.

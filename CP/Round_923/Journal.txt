# Experience

# Learning

1. Reading manga and all helped in some way or the other.
2. Sometimes you just dont need to give up and just move forward and focus on the moment.
    1. And in other times you are in a flow state.
3. Variables and functions are the lifeline of a program if you mess them up they will mess you up.
    1. It is so important to manipulate them in the correct order.
    2. Agar main kisi function ko bana raha hu to just focus on that function, agar main kisi condition ko likh raha hu to just focus on that condition.
        1. Test everything, let it be in the brain, in a notebook, or by logs.

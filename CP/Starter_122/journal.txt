# Objective

1. To upsolve.
2. To make dry run

# Experience

1. Experience was quite good.
    1. I did dry run.
    2. I got AC in first attempt.
2. In the last question I was no where near the correct algorithm.

# Learnings

1. I have to leave my stalking habits.
    1. Focus more on myself.
    2. Stalking in terms of rating and not in terms of code. After all I have see others code and learn from them.
2. Process to solve questions.
    1. Make claims, i.e. observations.
    2. Spend some more time claiming your claims.
    3. If the claim turn out to be true for all the edge cases.
    4. Make an algorithm.
    5. Make the pseudo code out of it.
    6. Dry run the algorithm and the pseudo code.
    7. Write code.
    8. Test the mini portions of the code while writing it.
        1. This is help in those situations where your algorithm is correct but code doesnâ€™t give expected output.
    9. Debug if you get stuck.
3. At one point I might have to level up theoretically.
    1. Not as of now.
    2. As for now, if I do one or two more questions.
    3. or I do it fast I will make decent enough progress for the next few contest.
4. Templates have many functions I could use like.
5. When get stuck talk to yourself.
6. Use the rubber duck analogy.
7. One of the good tip is that when get stuck don't just quit or blank yourself.
    1. Just try.
    2. Talk to yourself.
    3. One thing only to me is that I cannot work while being overwhelmed by thoughts or clutterness.
        1. So clear your thoughts.
        2. Clear your prenotions.
        3. Clear your code. {This is such a underrated tip}
        4. Repeat the entire process.

# Objective

1. Just to get real-world experience.
2. Use all the same learnings of the previous competitions I have given.

# Experience

1. Quite displeased because I am very tired now.
2. But I will try my best.
3. This made my day.
4. The start was good, I solved one question ASAP.
5. The second one was difficult.
6. The third one was even more difficult.
7. Let me elaborate on what I mean by difficult.
    1. I had to break down more, i.e. more layers had to be unwrapped.
    2. More edge cases had to be handled.
8. I got carried away many times.
    1. When I saw the difficulty level of the second question.
    2. When I solved the second question and ranked no 1.
    3. I was fastening the solutions.
    4. When I did that deep breathing, I somehow got back my senses.
    5. But even in the last 5 minutes I could have done that easily, I just had to do it without thinking about time.
9. The best part was that I didnâ€™t give up and that helped me.

# Learnings.

1. Sometimes it's just about breaking down the problem and solving it part by part.
2. I need to learn to control my emotions.
3. Learnings like doing one question at a time and not being kanjoos while the dry run was quite useful.

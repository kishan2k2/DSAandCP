# Objective

1. I am getting bored with the development thing, and I need something more engaging for a bit.
2. See the whereabouts of code force.
    1. After all, it is more reputed, right?
3. Using a standard template.
4. Again use chatGPT, using the smart way.
    1. i.e. Use it to code some portion that you know the logic of but dont want/Dont know how to code it.
    2. After getting the code for god sake don’t just copy-paste it and expect to work it like magic, and don’t panic if it doesn’t. Treat it like an assistant and not like a teacher.
5. To know if it also has DSA-based questions or just pure maths and patterns like the CodeChef ones.
    1. Though I expect the former one.
6. Iam a beginner and For me it is not about doing the question fast I just have to do it with full focus and take as much time as possible.
7. After giving the contest-: 
    1. Clear the task list and make the video for the hackathon.

# Experience

1. The contest has been ended.
    1. See if I can do problem D.
    2. No matter what see the solution of problem C.
2. Later I understood that it is not the mistake of mine that questions are not getting solved even if logic seem to be correct.
    1. It’s just that the input are getting registered.
    2. The problem is in the code and not in the logic so not much of a concern, but still need to work on it.
3. Will do some in-depth analysis and Lets see what else happen

1. Analysis.
    1. It's not like I couldn’t solve the questions.
    2. I should definitely try to give codeforces contests as well.
    3. Make your own template, and see the work arounds and all.
    4. I could have problem C and D easily. Don't know about problem E.
2. Will make some kind of a application using the API.

# Learning

1. Make your own template and see the work arounds like fix that error of vectors and all.

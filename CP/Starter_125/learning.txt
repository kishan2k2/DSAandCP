# Objective.

1. To try my best and not to give up.
2. Don’t do jaldbaazi, see question, all the test cases, imagine edge cases, make algo, test on all of them, make psuedo code, test on them, then submit.
    1. It will take time but its not the concern.
3. Maintain the momentum or the flow.
    1. It is not broken with errors, it is broken with unexpectedness.
    2. Test the code while writting it all the time.
4. Use GPT or gemini effectively.
5. When get wrong, dont worry take a step back and think about it.
6. Process to solve questions.
    1. Make claims, i.e. observations.
    2. Spend some more time claiming your claims.
    3. If the claim turn out to be true for all the edge cases.
    4. Make an algorithm.
    5. Make the pseudo code out of it.
    6. Dry run the algorithm and the pseudo code.
    7. Write code.
    8. Test the mini portions of the code while writing it.
        1. This is help in those situations where your algorithm is correct but code doesn’t give expected output.
        2. This is an important depth cause when it will get while up I get overwhelmed and when I get overwhelmed I don't perform good enough.
    9. Debug if you get stuck.

# Experience.

1. Second question mein kya toh BT hui, I wish ki early debug ho jaata toh aur bhi achi rank aa jaati.
2. Iam proud of the way I solved the 4th question.
    1. So fast and easily.
    2. That is because the algorithm was right and I was testing the code while I was writting it.
        1. It is so much important, check every part of the algorithm.
            1. Most importantly if you dont make the pseudo code.
            2. But this will only work if the pseudo code is correct.

# Learning.

1. Mein toh bas khus hu ki meri rating badh gayi.
    1. Infact mujhe iss baat pe khus hona chahiye ki meine last question tak give up nahi kiya.
    2. Infact last question mein meine kardiya tha after the first soution didn’t work out.
        1. No regrets, But I shouldn’t do that.
2. For the next time, just do the dsa sheet wale questions it will be helpful somehow.
    1. Though I could also do the sheet question of TLE. But doing standard DSA is more important as of now.
    2. I can view the question of TLE sheet.

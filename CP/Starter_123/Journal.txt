# Objective

1. To set up sublime after the contest.
    1. I will after upsolving.
2. To not stalk other profile after the contest.
    1. I did it somehow, but improved a lot.
3. To solve the question and not only the approach of the question.
    1. Next thing to do.
4. To solve only one question at a time.
    1. If it is hard it is hard for all don’t worry about others.
    2. I did.
5. Read the question and understand it before approaching.
    1. Never do the mistake of proceeding while half ass understanding.
    2. I should have done it, i.e. following the procedure of making algo then pseudo code and then the real code.
6. Agar kuch na aaye toh use GPT, use web.
    1. Learn and grow within contest it doesn’t matter.
    2. It’s hard to do it for these kind of CP contest.
    3. Some thing else matter more than just brute/New concepts.
        1. i.e. How you use the existing knowledge, it comes with experience, and seeing more questions.
7. Process to solve
    1. Make claims, i.e. observations.
    2. Spend some more time claiming your claims.
    3. If the claim turn out to be true for all the edge cases.
    4. Make an algorithm.
    5. Make the pseudo code out of it.
    6. Dry run the algorithm and the pseudo code.
    7. Write code.
    8. Test the mini portions of the code while writing it.
        1. This is help in those situations where your algorithm is correct but code doesn’t give expected output.
        2. This is an important depth cause when it will get while up I get overwhelmed and when I get overwhelmed I don't perform good enough.
    9. Debug if you get stuck.
8. Talk to yourself.
    1. Find a way, do give up.
9. Keeping a list of observations.
    1. Connect all.
    2. Do rely on brain too much.
        1. Keep it free and relaxed.

# Experience

1. One of the contest with a peaceful start.
    1. Prestart.
2. The start was sooo sooo good.
    1. The best start fr.
3. One question got swapped.
    1. Though that should have been anticipated.
4. I got stuck in one of the question.
    1. But thankfully I got out.
        1. And that too without following the regular approach. Not to appreciate this behaviour though.
    2. Though not much penalty But I was stuck for soo loong time. In both of those questions.
        1. And they we way to easy to be stuck in them.
            1. Would be interested in their rating and all.
    3. I didn’t give up until the last moment that is why I was able to do that middle question even after moving on to new question.
        1. If the new question had some more hope then I guess that I would have not done it.

# Learning

1. I seriously need to be disattached.
    1. But how should I, I mean If I put my hard work, shouldn’t I be expecting some kind of result.
        1. I should expect to learn a have a good journey.
2. I seriously need to follow those things which were meant to be done.
3. One single thing that always hinders me is that.
    1. Working with focus and stress free.
    2. Whenever I don’t work with full focus and stress free, there is always some kind of a regret that I could have done more.
4. I should hide the portion showing live rating.
5. By next week I will be prepared.
    1. With some Good level dsa and questions in my hood. Though there is shifting and all, but I am confident I will do it somehow.

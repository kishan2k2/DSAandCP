# Objective

1. Didn’t had the time for thinking about objectives and all.

# Experience.

1. 4 mins before the competition I had to rush to bathroom
2. The experience was not at all great.
3. I had to runaway from my main account.
    1. A shameful experience.
4. Atleast I gave the competition

# Learning.

1. One of the most important learning.
    1. I have to prioritize the contest, or the results won’t favor me.
    2. i.e. I have to have a proper rest some study, don’t just do it in a hurry.
    3. These things matter a lot cause I just couldn’t do the first question for 20 min straight on my main account.
        1. I got shit scared and returned to my alt account.
            1. A cowardly move though.
2. Don’t just blindly trust the constraint's.
    1. i.e. The working solution for count subarray was O(n^2)
    2. Although this is not a advice I would say always see and judge yourself.
3. Codechef is different than others.
    1. It has so many divisions and separation level that we don’t start with very easy question.
    2. Just a subtle thing to be noted.
        1. It is just to humbelling to not solve the first question as soon as possible, but it’s a worth while experience to have.

# To do for future.

1. I expect to have a calmer experience.
2. I want to have clear objective.
    1. Process driven, and not result oriented.
3. I want to have start with lesser expectation.

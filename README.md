# DSA_CP Repository

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) repository! In this repository, I have gathered the code for various DSA problems that I have solved. The problems are sourced from LeetCode, Codeforces, Codechef, and other competitive coding platforms.

Though I try to push all the codes, but I couldn't always because it becomes just too much to commit.

## Branches

### 1. **master**
   - This branch contains all the codes from other branches, serving as a consolidated collection of all solved problems.

### 2. **CP (Competitive Programming)**
   - This branch includes questions solved during contests on Codeforces, Codechef, and other competitive coding platforms.

### 3. **LeetCode**
   - This branch is dedicated to problems solved on LeetCode and general DSA questions.

### 4. **Codepython**
   - This branch is specific to problems solved using the Python programming language. I am actively working on mastering Python, and this branch reflects my progress in solving DSA problems with Python.

## How to Navigate

1. If you are interested in a comprehensive collection of all solved problems, check out the `master` branch.

2. For problems related to competitive programming, visit the `CP` branch.

3. If you are looking for LeetCode problems or general DSA questions, explore the `LeetCode` branch.

4. To see solutions implemented in Python, head over to the `Codepython` branch.
